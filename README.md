#Kolom

A responsive web design toolkit

##Introduction
Kolom was started to aid developers, and designers, in rapidly producing production quality web designs without having to get loss in the maze of browser behavior and usability. Its primary goals were to place a flexible, mobile ready, responsive framework in the hands of designers and developers who want to quickly take a design from concept to prototype to production without having to worry about typography, whitespace, widgets, and other common web design elements. Kolom takes care of many of the small things, so that developers don't have to.

###Layouts
The first element you'll encounter in Kolom is the "layout". This is simply a container that wraps around other content to organize it, visually, when rendered to the page. Usually, there will only be a single layout element on a page, but there is nothing stopping you from having several if your design has need of it. By default, layouts are centered horizontally on the page, and will automatically resize (respond) based on viewport width.
